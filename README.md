# cipher

* `benedict thing.py` = used to split up and recombine vigenere ciphers
* `bifidanneal.py` = Attempt at annealing Bifid ciphers based on semi-comprehensible online resources on annealing. May or may not work, depending on the weather.
* `bifidvariance.py` = generates bifid variance graphs
* `bigramfinder.py` = counts the number of times each bigram appears in the cipher
* `box.py` = full box cipher solver
* `cipher.py`  = simple letter substitution; useful for trying keys
* `cipher2.py` = full-featured multipurpose substitution solver program, confirmed to be bug-ridden
* `hillcipher.py` = partially completed hill cipher solver
* `hill2.py` = partial hill bruteforcer
* `hillaaron.py` = hill bruteforcer
* `keyword.py` = cracks keyword substitution ciphers
* `keywordswapper.py` = swaps between plain -> cipher and cipher -> plain vignere keywords
* `letterfinder.py` = outputs all the locations of a chosen letter in a string
* `letterfreq.py` = just a simple frequency analysis program
* `letternum.py` = finds the letter of a number or the number of a letter
* `pdssyndicate.py` = searching for 'dssynd' in substitution ciphers
* `reverse.py` = reverses whatever string you throw in its general direction
* `splittar.py` = splits strings into sections of a chosen length
* `totalconnie thing.py` = finds that number that i can't remember the name of for a range of vigenère keyword lengths
* `vigenere.py` = solves vigenère ciphers given the keyword
* `vigenerefreq.py` = makes a best guess at a vigenère cipher using letter frequency analysis
